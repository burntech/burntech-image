How to set up your own rPi3 (or similar) BurnTech Server:

1) Download "burntech1.0.img.zip" from the Google Drive:


2) Uncompress this file, and write it onto an SD card of 2GB (or larger).


  If you know what you're doing, this is likely to work:

      % sudo dd bs=4M if=burntech1.0.img of=/dev/mmcblk0

  If not, or for a refresher, there are a bazillion ways to do it here:

3) Put this card in your (ideally) Raspberry Pi 3, and give it power.

4) Give it a moment, then log on to your new wireless router:

   ssid:  BurnTech
   pw:    Password!

5) ssh to your new server:

   % ssh pi@192.168.10.1

   pw:   raspberry


   NOTE:  This is now a fully functional wireless access point.  If you
   hook up an ethernet cable from the pi to your existing router, you can
   log onto this server, and surf the web.


6) Configure your wireless as you see fit, and makes some other useful
   improvements.  Now you have a server!

   % sudo ./burntech_config.pl
