CREATING AN SD CARD FROM A .img FILE

    Insert new card (it can be any card, but you *will* erase it).

    Make sure your adaptor is unlocked.

    Once inserted, unmount all mounted partitions.

    Try this if you're using an adaptor on an existing image:

        sudo umount /dev/mmblk0p2 /dev/mmblk0p1


    Then create a new image, like so

        sudo dd bs=4M if=burntech1.0.img of=/dev/mmcblk0

        sudo dd bs=4M if=cnfcv4.img | pv | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M 
    
        sudo dd bs=4M if=2016-11-25-raspbian-jessie-lite.img | pv | sudo dd of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=4M 



CREATING A .img FILE FROM YOUR PI SD CARD

    You may need to log in to the pi, and "sudo shutdown -h now"
    to get a clean image.

    for the first step, lock the adaptor, but leave the card 
    mounted (should be two directories if this is an existing pi system):

        sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/mmcblk0 | pv | sudo dd of=cnfcv5.img

    NOTE:  

    To make an image smaller than your SD card, you need to shrink your image 
    (try gparted), then ascertain how many sectors you actually need to copy
    (try sudo fdisk -l /dev/mmcblk0 or similar), then use dd to only copy that much:

        sudo dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=burntech.img bs=512 count=[number of last sector from fdisk+1]
